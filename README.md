## Overview of the internal Egyptian etymologies of Coptic words

Coptic is the last language stage of Egyptian. For more information on Coptic culture see <https://ccdl.claremont.edu/digital/collection/cce>.
Coptic words are accessible through the great [Coptic Dictionary Online](https://coptic-dictionary.org/), which is based on reusable data.
The language stages before Coptic have independent lexicographical traditions. Reusable lexicographical data is not yet available for Demotic. The [TLA](https://aaew.bbaw.de/tla/) offers digital access to demotic words and their references.
Reusable data for Egyptian has been implemented in [ORAEC](https://oraec.github.io/corpus/).

This repository offers a mapping of indigenous Coptic words with their predecessors. Only those words are listed for which an Egyptian etymology is known. The Coptic words and their predecessors are represented in the CSV by the IDs of the respective databases. The first column of the CSV contains the ID from the Coptic Dictionary Online. The second column contains the ID of the Egyptian word as used in ORAEC. The third column contains the ID of the demotic word from the TLA.

Example: ```C1494,159410,6439```
C1494 is the ID of the Coptic lemma ⲕⲁϩ, see <https://coptic-dictionary.org/entry.cgi?tla=C1494>. This Coptic word has an Egyptian and a Demotic predecessor. The Egyptian predecessor has the ID 159410 and can be found at <https://oraec.github.io/corpus/159410.html>. It is qꜣḥ. The third column contains the ID of the demotic predecessor: 6439. The entry can be found in the TLA under <https://aaew.bbaw.de/tla/servlet/GetWcnDetails?&wn=6439&db=1> and is qh.
